        <h2>About College</h2>
        Here is your short paragraph on My College ! My name is Tarun Seth. The
        name of my college is St. Josheph International College. I am a 2nd year
        Bachelor of Business Administration Student. I love my college a lot
        because it possesses all the qualities of an ideal college. We have
        excellent course curriculum and faculty members. Our lecturers hold a
        respectable place in the societies. My college Principal is very
        particular in appointing the lecturers. This is the reason nobody takes
        tuition classes after the college hours like students of other colleges.
        It is my firm belief that education is the best way to enlighten young
        minds and it can only be imparted in a good environment having
        prosperous thinking. My college has all what it takes. ADVERTISEMENTS:
        Our faculties present educational process/ programs in a congenial
        manner. My college charges nominal fees as compared to other colleges in
        the city due to which students from all strata of society are able to
        study here. In our country education is not given that much importance
        and so it is not taken seriously my many scholars. This is because there
        is a big loop is the way the education is taught in many schools and
        colleges. ADVERTISEMENTS: The concept of education is misunderstood my
        many students. Students want to study in order to make money and become
        rich so that they can fulfill their wants. Similarly money is invested
        by parents in terms of the amount of investment it will reap in the
        future. Because of this reason females are not given much higher
        education in our country. Teachers nowadays also opt colleges and
        schools where they do not have to give daily lectures and can make
        double earning by college salaries and personal home tuitions. I wonder
        thinking what is my countryâ€™s future is going to be like if this
        continues to happen. Careers are opted solely on the basis of high
        salaries. Those who fail to pass the examinations easily purchases the
        degrees. Fortunately my college has a very strict discipline regarding
        the marking scheme. All those who do not perform well are made to repeat
        the exams to make sure that they acquire deep knowledge about the
        subjects. We have separate panel of teachers who identifies our
        potentials and guides us which career we should choose & in which
        industries we can accelerate well in terms of our skills and abilities.
        To solve our difficulties our teachers conducts extra sessions for us so
        that we do not have to take the help of tutors and score well in the
        exams. Like other colleges in the city my college is not built to earn
        profits. The target here is to impart excellent education and come out
        with bright careers so as the shape our future in the best possible
        manner.
